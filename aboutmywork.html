    <p>Have experience in Appium WinApp driver that automates WPF/Windows applications. 
        The domain I am working is shipping. My primary task is to test the priority build for the application that is about to get deployed for the user acceptance testing. I have to perform Smoke as well
        as Regression testing. To reduce the manual effort I have to automate the every feasible manully executed test cases to save the human effort. Once build stability is done we will begin to execute the 
        sanity test cases which is more like an extensive way to test the application and verify whether all the intended functionalities are working as expected. Once Sanity testing is done the application will be 
        tested by the Business Analysts and then will be deployed for User Acceptance testing. Once user acceptance testing is completed, all the test data will be cleaned and the application goes into
        production.</p>
